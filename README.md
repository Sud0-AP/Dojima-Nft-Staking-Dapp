# Staking dAPP

## Overview

We are building an NFT staking dapp which will be using the contract we built in the nft-collection. The dapp will allow users to stake their NFTs and earn rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens. The dapp will also allow users to unstake their NFTs and withdraw their rewards.
